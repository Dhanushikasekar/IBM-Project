# IBM-Project
Project Description:
The SmartSDLC project is an AI-enhanced platform designed to automate and streamline the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) using advanced technologies like IBM Watsonx, FastAPI, LangChain, and Streamlit. It integrates generative AI to handle key SDLC phases, including requirement analysis, code generation, test case creation, bug fixing, and documentation. The platform features a user-friendly interface that allows users to upload PDFs, generate structured requirements, and transform natural language prompts into functional code. It also includes an AI-powered chatbot for real-time assistance and support. The backend, built with FastAPI, efficiently processes API requests, while the frontend, developed using Streamlit, offers a visually appealing and interactive dashboard. The system is modular, scalable, and secure, featuring a robust authentication mechanism and seamless integration between AI models and user inputs. Deployment is streamlined with local hosting via Uvicorn and Streamlit, with comprehensive API documentation available through Swagger UI. By leveraging AI in a practical and efficient manner, SmartSDLC significantly reduces manual workload, accelerates development processes, and enhances software quality, making it an invaluable tool for developers and project teams.
